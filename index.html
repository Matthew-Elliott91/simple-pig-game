      <h1>How to Play Pig (Player vs. Computer)</h1>
      <h2>
        The game of Pig is a simple dice game played between you and the
        computer. Here's how it works:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Players take turns rolling a dice as many times as they wish, adding
          the dice's value to their score for the turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you lose all the points you
          accumulated in that turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can choose to "Hold" to add the points from your turn to your
          total score and pass the dice to the computer.
        </li>
        <li>The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.</li>
        <li>
          The computer plays automatically, making its decisions based on a
          simple strategy.
        </li>
      </ul>
